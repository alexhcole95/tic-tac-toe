# Tic Tac Toe
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil 
game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three 
grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in 
a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, 
with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
