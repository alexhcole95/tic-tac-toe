# Tic Tac Toe
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil 
game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three 
grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in 
a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, 
with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

## Instructions
The in-game instructions are available once you run the program. It's fairly
self-explanatory, but to help make it easier just imagine the tic-tac-toe board 
as your numpad on your keyboard. The numbers 1-9 are the places you have available
to place your mark.

To run the program you have two options: 

1. This is the more immediate, easier option of the two. You can visit [this](https://replit.com/@alexhcole/tic-tac-toe)
repl and click the large `RUN` button at the top of the browser window. This will allow
the game to run in the console which is on the right side of the browser window. Feel 
free to fork the repl while you're here if you'd like to add it to your Replit!


2. The second, more technical option is to copy the code in main.py
(or [this](https://gist.github.com/alexhcole95/28666c75939e7f90cf765a1be7c2a251) gist)
and open it in a Python IDE or console. This option will require the
[Python](https://www.python.org) programming language to be installed, plus some 
basic understanding of how an IDE/console works.

## Development
This project really didn't require anything fancy or complex. The hardest part in the
coding process was making sense of the logic behind each turn, and that really wasn't
anything too crazy. I used PyCharm for the vast majority of the project, but swapped it
up to IntelliJ IDEA near the end. 

As far as the language goes, it's all Python. The only module used was the random module,
which determines what player goes first, and some tinkering with the
[PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/#) package. Unfortunately the executable
the package creates doesn't play well with git, otherwise I would have it in the repository.

## About Me
I'm a 27-year-old aspiring software engineer from Altoona, Alabama. I've been around computers
and technology all my life, which thankfully helps drive me to success in my professional endeavors.
Apart from Python, I have experience in Golang, SQL, HTML, CSS, and some Javascript. I've had several
computers throughout my life, so I'm proficient in multiple flavors of Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Something that motivates me is a challenge or an opportunity to learn something new. I am naturally
curious, so if I don't understand something, I will be sure to study up on it and familiarize myself.
That's why this journey of software engineering has been so fun, there's always something new out there
to explore!

Thanks for checking out my repository! Feel free to follow me here on GitHub, or connect with me on 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexhcole), if you'd like to keep up with my journey. Have a
wonderful day!
